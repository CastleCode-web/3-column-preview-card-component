## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to control responsiveness with just margin and padding alone.
I also learned how not adding heights maintain responsiveness, and why setting 
the widths in % is a good practice. 


### Useful resources

- (https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/) - This helped me understand how to control responsive layout with css only. It also give a detailed explanation on flexbox. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
